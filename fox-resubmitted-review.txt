This is a review of the resubmitted manuscript by Fox et al entitled "Newton's Second Law Lab Report". I recommend minor revisions.

Title: The title sounds like a high school lab report. It should isntead give some idea of the questions addressed or findings.

Throughout the authors use bulleted lists; it is preferable to just write in straight prose sentences without bullets.

The setup photo needs labels.

The procedure (methosd and materials) should NOT be given as cookbook steps. Write as prose, in past tense. Give enough details that a competent physicist could reproduce your results.

Similarly, the calculations are given as bullet point equations with no explanation. It is unclear why some are labeled "experimental" versus some are labeled "theoretical".



Results: In the results section Table 1 gives the data for acceleration. It appears that the team did 5 replicates but for only a single input force or choice of m2? Thus it is difficult to see how they tested their claims as they only have one data point.

Individual contributions are given as bullets when they should just be a sentence in the acknowledgements. 

No references are given.
